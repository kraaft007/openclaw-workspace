# 2026-02-17 Daily Notes

## Late Night Session (~23:30 - 02:00 EST)

### Canvas + A2UI Issue
- Steven opened Canvas on MacMini, got "A2UI assets not found" error
- A2UI assets exist on VPS but may be missing from Mac's local OpenClaw install
- Suggested `npm install -g openclaw@latest` on Mac to fix

### Canvas Rendering — Lesson Learned ✅
- Steven asked me to demo the healthcheck dashboard on Canvas
- Spent time troubleshooting: node not connected, tried CLI commands that don't exist, tried navigate to VPS-local URLs
- **What finally worked:** `canvas.present` to open the window, then `canvas.eval` to inject full HTML directly via JS
- Steven saw the dashboard and confirmed it looks great
- **Written to MEMORY.md** as permanent reference for future Canvas rendering

### Node Connectivity Troubleshooting
- Gateway restarted at ~01:26, broke the Mac node connection
- Dashboard/webchat reconnected fine but node didn't
- Learned: Mac app has two separate connections (Dashboard vs Node)
- `openclaw nodes list` showed 0 nodes even when Mac app said connected — stale data issue
- Steven's screenshot confirmed 3 instances (VPS gateway, Mac remote, Mac node)
- Full app restart (Cmd+Q → relaunch) fixed the node connection

### Dashboard Pairing
- After gateway restart, Dashboard showed "Connected: Yes, Paired: No"
- Dashboard webchat needs to re-pair after gateway restarts
- Node pairing is separate from Dashboard pairing

## Afternoon (~14:58 EST)

### Cost Report Preference
- Steven asked why the 8:30 AM cost report wasn't relayed
- It DID run (all clear, $0 usage, $47.56 remaining) but I suppressed it since nothing was notable
- **Steven wants the daily cost report ALWAYS relayed at 8:30 AM**, even when all clear — serves as daily proof-of-life
