- Steven confirmed boomer64.com DNS is using Cloudflare nameservers (we previously directed him to set it up).
- Steven requested that Albert write more aggressively to memory files (MEMORY.md / memory/*.md) so setup details aren’t lost between model/config changes.
- Config changes made today: disabled nativeSkills injection (commands.nativeSkills=false), disabled all cron jobs, reduced heartbeat to once/day at ~10:00 America/Toronto.
