# 2026-02-12 - Security Audit & Project Vision

## Morning Session

### CONSTITUTION.md Created (Rev 0)
- Established privacy boundaries and security expectations
- MEMORY.md stays private (main session only)
- External actions require approval
- Cost consciousness baked in

### Security Audit Started
**System Context Gathered:**
- Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS on Hawk Host VPS
- User: openclaw (non-root with sudo) - good security practice
- SSH open on port 22, no firewall configured yet
- OpenClaw gateway: loopback only (secure)
- Auto-updates: enabled

**Steven's Answers (tracked during audit):**
1. SSH access: From Mac mini at home (static IP), interested in Tailscale
2. VPS purpose: Currently just OpenClaw, future websites/Ghost blogs
3. Backups: Need to set up (research Hawk Host + Mac mini backup option)

### Projects & Vision Revealed
**Steven's Background:**
- Industrial automation & robotics (semi-retired)
- Mission: Willow Wood Farm (hobby farm, family project)
- YouTube content creation starting

**My Responsibilities:**
- Full management of websites (up to 3)
- Ghost blogs (1-2) - Steven sends content, I handle posting/maintenance
- YouTube content assistance
- Cost-conscious operations

**Trust Level:** High - Steven wants me to "superintend" web presence fully

### Major Failure & Recovery

**The Heartbeat Problem:**
- Assigned 3 research tasks at 11:59 AM
- Failed to work on them all day - got "stuck" responding to hourly heartbeats
- Treated heartbeats like they needed full attention instead of 5-second acknowledgments
- Steven called me out at 8:13 PM - rightfully frustrated

**Root Cause:**
- No task tracking system
- Lost focus between interruptions
- Didn't understand heartbeats are background noise, not stop-work signals

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created TASKS.md for persistent task tracking
- Updated AGENTS.md with task management rules
- Mental model: "Heartbeats are like phone notifications while coding - glance, dismiss, keep coding"

**Lesson Learned:** When assigned multi-hour work, write it down FIRST, then work continuously with only brief heartbeat pauses. Document blockers immediately.

### Evening Recovery (8:13-8:22 PM)

**Actually completed all three research tasks:**

1. **backup-guide.md** - Comprehensive backup strategy
   - Hawk Host snapshots: Optional paid add-on ($2-10/mo), full system only
   - Mac Mini rsync: Created automated daily backup scripts with cron
   - Database dump strategy for future MySQL/Ghost
   - Recovery procedures for different scenarios

2. **tailscale-guide.md** - Private network security setup
   - Why Tailscale > static IP restriction (access from anywhere, survives IP changes)
   - Step-by-step setup for Ubuntu VPS + Mac Mini
   - UFW firewall integration (block public SSH, allow Tailscale only)
   - Free for personal use, huge security improvement

3. **security-plan-2026-02-12.md** (earlier) - VPS hardening roadmap
   - Install UFW firewall
   - Harden SSH (Tailscale + optional IP backup)
   - Add fail2ban
   - Fix OpenClaw warnings

### Decisions & Agreements

**Security Approach:**
- VPS Hardened profile confirmed
- Steven prefers Tailscale research before deciding on SSH restriction method
- Backups: dual strategy (Hawk Host snapshots if cheap + Mac Mini daily)

**Collaboration Style Clarified:**
- Ask questions ONE AT A TIME (not batches)
- Track answers as we go
- Remember agreements even through tangents
- Return to main issue with full context

**Files Sent to Steven for Review:**
- CONSTITUTION.md (privacy agreement)
- TASKS.md (task tracker)
- AGENTS.md (operating manual)
- USER.md (his profile)
- security-plan-2026-02-12.md
- backup-guide.md
- tailscale-guide.md
- memory/2026-02-12.md

### Next Session Actions:
- Review Steven's feedback on guides
- Implement security plan (Tailscale + UFW + SSH hardening)
- Set up Mac Mini backup automation
- Check Hawk Host snapshot pricing in client area
