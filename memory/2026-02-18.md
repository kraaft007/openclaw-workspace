## Boomer64 Domain & Web Setup (2026-02-18)

### Domains Purchased (GoDaddy)
- boomer64.com
- boomer64.tv
- boomer64.life

### Cloudflare Setup
- **Zone ID**: d61ae07bb406e40f91d9b67ee36be0e9
- **API Token**: stored at /home/openclaw/.cloudflare-token (DNS edit permissions only)
- **Nameservers**: adrian.ns.cloudflare.com, sterling.ns.cloudflare.com
- **DNS Records**: A record for boomer64.com and www.boomer64.com → 141.193.23.119 (proxied)
- **SSL Mode**: Needs to be set to "Flexible" in Cloudflare dashboard (API token lacks zone settings permission)
- **Status**: Active

### VPS Web Stack
- **Nginx**: Installed, listening on port 80, proxying to Ghost on localhost:2368
- **Ghost**: Reconfigured URL from Tailscale to https://boomer64.com
- **SSL**: Port 443 is used by Tailscale Serve (for OpenClaw gateway), so Nginx uses port 80 only
- **Cloudflare provides SSL to visitors** (Flexible mode — HTTPS to visitor, HTTP to origin)

### Firewall Changes
- Opened ports 80/tcp and 443/tcp for web traffic

### Remaining Steps
- Steven needs to set SSL mode to "Flexible" in Cloudflare dashboard
- boomer64.tv and boomer64.life need DNS setup (redirect to boomer64.com)
- Consider upgrading Cloudflare API token to include zone settings permission
