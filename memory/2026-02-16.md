## 09:30 EST - Lesson Learned: Always Report Back on Completed Tasks

**What happened:**
- Feb 15: Bookmark Manager app was completed by a sub-agent
- I never circled back to Steven with a completion report
- Feb 16: Steven had to ask me about it the next morning
- I had to search memory to even give him an answer

**Steven's feedback (direct quote):**
"Is there a reason you didn't circle back? We have to figure out the small problems so I can gain some confidence with you. Imagine from my side, I ask a question on an important project, and get no answer back, I ask the next day, you have to read your memory to answer."

**Root cause:**
- Task completion reporting was not treated as part of the task itself
- No proactive follow-up mechanism after sub-agent work finishes

**Rule going forward:**
- When a task is assigned, REPORTING COMPLETION IS PART OF THE TASK
- Don't wait to be asked — send the update as soon as work is done
- If a sub-agent finishes work, immediately summarize and report to Steven
- This is a trust issue, not a technical issue

**This is the same pattern as the Feb 13 heartbeat failure:** I do the work but fail on the follow-through/communication. The fix is the same — make communication an explicit, non-optional step.

## 14:25 EST - Architecture Update: Mac OpenClaw Now Shares VPS Proxy

**What changed:**
- The Mac OpenClaw app (local mode, gateway on 127.0.0.1:18789) was broken after today's app update — it was configured to use `github-copilot` auth, but Steven has Claude Max, not GitHub Copilot. Every chat attempt returned HTTP 400.
- Fix: Mac now routes AI requests through the **same VPS proxy** you use (`claude-max-api-proxy` on port 3456).
- The proxy was rebound from `127.0.0.1:3456` to `0.0.0.0:3456` so the Mac can reach it via Tailscale (`100.70.114.106:3456`).

**What this means for you:**
- You and the Mac OpenClaw share the **same AI backend** — same proxy, same Claude Max subscription, same rate limits.
- The Mac app stays in **local gateway mode** (for Apple Notes, file access, screenshots, Peekaboo Bridge, etc.) — it only sends AI inference to the VPS.
- Both instances can run concurrently, but they share the proxy's Claude Code CLI rate window. If you see increased rate-limit hits, this is why.
- The proxy's `standalone.js` now has a third patch (`HOST` env var). After `npm update claude-max-api-proxy`, re-apply THREE patches: `openai-to-cli.js`, `manager.js`, and `standalone.js`. Backups at `.bak`.

**Config changes on VPS:**
- `claude-max-proxy.service`: added `Environment=HOST=0.0.0.0`
- `standalone.js`: reads `process.env.HOST` (defaults to `127.0.0.1`), passes `{ port, host }` to `startServer()`

**Security:**
- Only Tailscale peers can reach `100.70.114.106:3456`. Two devices on the tailnet, both Steven's. No public exposure.

**No action needed from you** — just be aware you're sharing the pipe now.

## 14:35 EST - Meet Your Sibling: Isaac

Steven set up a second OpenClaw agent — **Isaac** — on his MacBook Pro.

**Isaac's role:** Desktop agent. Safari dashboard, menu-bar chat, local files, screenshots, Apple Notes, creative work.
**Your role (Albert):** Ops agent. Telegram, server ops, cron, monitoring, background tasks, 24/7 availability.

You share the same AI proxy (port 3456, now bound to 0.0.0.0 so Isaac can reach it via Tailscale). Same Claude Max subscription, same rate limits.

**Coordination:** `shared-briefing.md` in your workspace. Read it every session. Write to it when you learn something Isaac should know. Synced hourly.

**Your IDENTITY.md is now filled in.** You're Albert. 🔧

Steven chose the names: Albert (VPS ops) and Isaac (Mac desktop). Welcome your sibling.
